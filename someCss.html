	Airplane! (titled Flying High! in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Japan and the Philippines) is a 1980 
	American satirical parody film directed and written by David and Jerry Zucker as well as Jim Abrahams,[4] and 
	produced by Jon Davison. It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty and features Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Lloyd 
	Bridges, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Lorna Patterson.[4] The film is a parody of the disaster film genre, 
	particularly the 1957 Paramount film Zero Hour!, from which it borrows the plot and the central characters,[5] as well
	 as many elements from Airport 1975. The film is known for its use of surreal humor and its fast-paced slapstick comedy,
	  including visual and verbal puns and gags. (From WIKIPEDIA)</p>
